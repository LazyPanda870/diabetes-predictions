Diabetes is one of the most common diseases worldwide where a cure is not found for it yet. Annually it costs a lot of money to care for people with diabetes. Thus the most important issue is the prediction to be very accurate and to use a reliable method for that. One of these methods is using a machine learning model.  So in this paper, we used machine learning to predict whether a person is diabetic or not. To build the onset  Diabetes predictor by machine learning we will PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on. After training the machine learning model using a random forest algorithm, the average probability was 0.75 and the accuracy of the prediction of whether a person is diabetics or not was 77.3% but we used a machine-learning algorithm to increase the probability and accuracy of prediction whether a patient has diabetes or not! That algorithm is known as Xgboost.
